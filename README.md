**Description**
Bruin Bites is a website that allows UCLA students to more easily connect with their friends through food! Right off the bat, a new user can use the website to view what each restaurant/take-out option is serving, view their respective ratings, and even make them themselves. However, if a user wants to become more involved, they can make their own user profile that will give the user their own distinct flair and track their activity/contributions to the website. This includes displaying a quick description of themselves, their favorite places to eat, and the ratings they have written. To add onto the user experience, the website also has night mode!
